        <h5>The Need: Android and web apps that meet consumer demands</h5>

        <p>
          Snaptee’s iOS app enables users to design their own custom t-shirts and send them to print. With its seed funding secured, Snaptee wanted to ride on their iOS app’s success and needed an app and web development partner to rapidly deploy Android and web-based products to meet consumer demands and expand its footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a growing Hong Kong startup, Snaptee wanted a partner that has first-hand startup experience in creating iterative products. They wanted to create an independent Android app that would give a consistent user experience across a multitude of mobile screen sizes and interfaces.
        </p>
       

        <h5>
          Oursky’s Strategy: Provide a unified, cross-platform solution
        </h5>
        <p>
          The Oursky team first explored Snaptee's iOS app together with Snaptee’s engineers and designers to fully understand the original product. Then, Oursky developed a standalone Android app and a separate web marketplace platform on Shopify that complemented Snaptee’s young and energetic brand identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the custom t-shirt layout printing process was previously for iOS only, we recreated a layout engine that accurately printed t-shirt layout designs on Android apps. In addition, we created filters for Snaptee's Android app that were previously only available natively for iPhone users. The overall tech stack used for the project were Java for Android and Shopify for web.
        </p>
        <h5>The Result: Over one million t-shirt designs across 55 countries</h5>

        <p>
          With its growing global user base, Snaptee also looked into making its online retail store be more cost-effective. We built a customized Shopify store to help Snaptee rapidly test its new business idea on the feature-rich e-commerce platform. To date, Snaptee’s platform has over one million t-shirt designs and ships orders to 55 countries. ABC News 10 selected it in their App of the Day feature.
